Web-Clipper is a chrome extension that extract the main content of a news web page and display the news in a clean view. It is designed to improve user's online reading experience. As for none-news web page, it won't work.

Things sound a litter similar to  [Evernote](https://evernote.com/intl/zh-cn/sign-up/) and [Readability](https://www.readability.com/),both of which also can turn web page into a clean view. Yes! All of the three share the same belief: more focus,less distraction. But we can make it different. In addition to only content display, we can do a further job based on the content, such as emotion analysis,abstract extraction,keywords match,etc. A lot of interesting things can be done, so let's move on! :clap::clap::clap:
