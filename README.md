## Web-Clipper

A chrome extension which has similar function to Evernote is based on an self-imagined Node-Type-Labeled Algorithom,
it now can be used to display the main content of a web page.Sometimes it does not work very well for which

There are serveral things need to be handled to become a better version.

- algorithom improved.
- code refacter to meet common pattern.
- ...

Issues are welcome.
